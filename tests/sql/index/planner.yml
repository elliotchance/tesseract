  These tests are responsible for making sure the query planner uses indexes
  when it should, but also does not use an index when it shouldn't.

  At this time tesseract always uses an index even if the table is zero rows.
  This may change in the future, but for now expect that the query planner
  should always use an index if it fulfills the expression requirement.

data:
  blank: []

tests:
  is_null:
    data: blank
    sql:
    - CREATE INDEX myindex ON blank (x)
    - EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM blank WHERE x IS null
    result:
    - {"description": "Index lookup using myindex for null"}
