  These tests are responsible for making sure the query planner uses indexes
  when it should, but also does not use an index when it shouldn't.

  At this time tesseract always uses an index even if the table is zero rows.
  This may change in the future, but for now expect that the query planner
  should always use an index if it fulfills the expression requirement.

  blank: []

  is_null:
    data: blank

    - CREATE INDEX myindex ON blank (x)
    - EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM blank WHERE x IS null
    result:

      We do not have the ability to do inverse lookups, so fall back to a full
      table scan.
    data: blank
    sql:
    - CREATE INDEX myindex ON blank (x)
    - EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM blank WHERE x IS NOT null
    result:
    - {"description": "Full scan of table 'blank'"}
    - {"description": "Filter: x IS NOT null"}

  is_true:
    data: blank
    sql:
    - CREATE INDEX myindex ON blank (x)
    - EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM blank WHERE x IS true
    result:
    - {"description": "Index lookup using myindex for value true"}

  is_false:
    data: blank
    sql:
    - CREATE INDEX myindex ON blank (x)
    - EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM blank WHERE x IS false
    result:
    - {"description": "Index lookup using myindex for value false"}

      Only null, true and false can be looked up by value. The other types are
      actually more complicated range queries so we must fall back to full table
      scans.
    data: blank
    sql:
    - CREATE INDEX myindex ON blank (x)
    - EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM blank WHERE x IS number
    result:
    - {"description": "Full scan of table 'blank'"}
    - {"description": "Filter: x IS number"}

  equal_left:
    data: blank
    sql:
    - CREATE INDEX myindex ON blank (x)
    - EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM blank WHERE x = 123
    result:
    - {"description": "Index lookup using myindex for value 123"}

  equal_right:
    data: blank
    sql:
    - CREATE INDEX myindex ON blank (x)
    - EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM blank WHERE 123 = x
    result:
    - {"description": "Index lookup using myindex for value 123"}
